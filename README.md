# Lubuntu CI Tooling

This is the tooling originally designed for the Lubuntu CI, visible at [ci.lubuntu.me](https://ci.lubuntu.me/). It can be used for a variety of projects and is extendable using a simple YAML file.

This is currently a work in progress and this README will be updated as features are implemented.
